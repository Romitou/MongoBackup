```
```yml
# Where the logs are located
logPath: "./logs.log"

# The Mongo URI used to connect to the database
mongoUri: "mongodb://127.0.0.1/"

# The archive password
zipPassword: "supersecretpassword"

# Example: https://discord.com/api/webhooks/763413460892641305/gFx3ERX1IVmyVJ2etAXfQ8OVIYARz06JUmXzJOW8Z5ALv4-GE5lkW
webhook:
  id: "763413460892641305"
  token: "gFx3ERX1IVmyVJ2etAXfQ8OVIYARz06JUmXzJOW8Z5ALv4-GE5lkW"

### It's secure üîí
When storing or uploading to Discord, the archive is encrypted with a password you set in the configuration. Only those who know the password can read the archive containing the backup.
